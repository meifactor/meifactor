## 👋 Hi there, I'm Meitalia Factor

I'm a junior at **Barnard College of Columbia University**, studying **Computer Science** and **Ancient Studies**, a blend that reflects my curiosity for both structured logic and big-picture thinking. As a full-stack software engineer, I'm passionate about building systems that are not only technically sound but thoughtful in how they’re used.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On
- 🧠 Building next-gen AI-powered developer tools at [Columbia's Design Tools Lab](https://designtoolslab.org), where I lead front-end integration for real-time code editing and flow visualization.
- 🔐 Developing identity verification systems and smart contract features as a returning **Fullstack Intern** at [Hashfire](https://www.hashfire.xyz), a blockchain startup and winner of Avalanche’s Codebase Incubator.
- 💬 Exploring how to make programming education more accessible by integrating LLMs into beginner environments.

### 🧠 About Me
What first drew me to coding wasn’t just the logic, it was the creativity. I love the feeling of bringing an idea to life from scratch, whether it’s an interactive web app, an AI-assisted interface, or a tool that helps someone learn faster. I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments where I can iterate quickly, build with others, and see real impact.

To me, software engineering is equal parts problem-solving and storytelling, and I’m always chasing projects that let me create, experiment, and ship things that matter. I’m passionate about building things that didn’t exist yesterday, and happiest when people can use my projects to change their everyday lives, tools so intuitive and useful that they couldn’t imagine life without them once they’re in the world.

### 💼 Experience Highlights

**🧪 Columbia University Design Tools Lab**, *Research Assistant*  
*Jan 2025 – Present*  
> Designing intelligent developer tools at Columbia's Design Tools Lab, where I build both front-end (React, CodeMirror, ReactFlow) and back-end (Node.js) systems, and lead AI prompt engineering efforts using GPT-4 to generate dynamic, context-aware visualizations that help beginners understand code structure and logic in real time.

**🔥 Hashfire**, *Fullstack Development Intern*  
*Dec 2024 – Present*  
> Initially brought on to build smart contract UI components in React, I was invited back to lead summer development of identity verification tools. I architected backend flows with Node.js, MongoDB, and JWT-based auth to support secure, scalable user onboarding. 

**👩‍💻 Girls Who Code**, *Teaching Assistant*  
*May 2024 – Aug 2024*  
> Helped over 150 high school students grasp JavaScript and creative coding with p5.js. Designed custom debugging walkthroughs and live-coded animations to keep things hands-on, and co-led curriculum improvements using feedback loops and Agile retros.

**🌿 Neighborhood Farms USA**, *Software Engineering Intern*  
*Jan 2022 – Nov 2023*  
> Took charge of the nonprofit's full-stack tech stack. Rebuilt their site to improve SEO and performance (30% faster load times), integrated a CRM and payment system, and helped them meet 40% of their annual donation target in just one quarter.

### 🎸 Outside the Terminal
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me **writing fiction**, **exploring NYC’s side streets**, or hunting for the next great coffee spot (I’m a Blue Bottle loyalist ☕). I love building **community gardens**, learning about **urban farming**, and spending time with animals. Whether I’m getting lost in a story or a new neighborhood, I’m always chasing creativity, in and out of the terminal.
